# Spam-SMS-Classification
This project implements an SMS spam detection system using machine learning techniques. It leverages the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle, which contains thousands of text messages labeled as spam or ham (not spam). The messages are preprocessed by cleaning and removing stopwords, then transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained on this data to effectively distinguish spam messages from legitimate ones. The project includes evaluation metrics such as accuracy and a detailed classification report, alongside visualizations like the distribution of message types and a confusion matrix using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Additionally, it provides functionality to predict whether new messages are spam or not. The code is designed to be clear and easy to run, making it suitable for educational purposes or as a foundation for more advanced spam detection systems.
